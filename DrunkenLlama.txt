Principal choice will be how many of the opposing Pokemon each poke can beat. 
This will be done by calcing at max defense, middle defense, and min defense. 
If the Pokemon scores an unconditional OHKO and avoids OHKO back(by outspeeding/surviving), it beats it.
If it scores a 2HKO while avoiding 2HKO, it beats it, etc.
To calculate defensive viability assume opponent Pokemon has stab moves with BP 70.
This is likely because most fire types learn 80% of fire moves, etc. check on SpDef and def. 

Each Pokemon gets +1 for every poke it beats, -1 for every one it fails to, +0 for unknown outcomes. Poke with highest score is sent out. 

After opponent is sent out calc each move's damage.
If the moves nasty plot or swords dance or metal sound or screech are available, they should be considered.
If the opponent poke is faster, thunder wave should always be chosen.
If the opponent is susceptible to burns and wow is an option and opponent has much higher atk then spa, wow should be considered.
Any sleeping move should be considered.
Any move less than 70 accuracy should be ignored unless the matchup is lost without it.

Nasty plot/sd/screech/ms should be chosen if the strongest move does not OHKO. 

After each move this process should be reevaluated. If poke is burned this can change the most powerful move, likewise opponent boosts.

On result "Good game"
