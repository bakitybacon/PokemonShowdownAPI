PokemonShowdownAPI
==================

A Java thing (I won't say library) that deals with Pokemon Showdown (http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/). It aims to be a client but right now it's just a chat interface.

Cool ideas I'll eventually add:

Collective team weakness in teambuilder
Common walls that aren't dealt with
sweepers that aren't dealt with
team archetypes
integrated damage calc
