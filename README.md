PokemonShowdownAPI
==================

A Java thing (I won't say library) that deals with Pokemon Showdown (http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/). It aims to be a client but right now it's just a chat interface.

Cool ideas I'll eventually add:

* Collective team weakness in teambuilder

* Common walls that aren't dealt with

* sweepers that aren't dealt with

* team archetypes

* integrated damage calc

Copied Honko's damagecalc by basically translating it into Java.
The JS can be found at http://pokemonshowdown.com/damagecalc/damage.js.

Currently, I need to:

* finish translating battle messages to plain text
